### Install OpenCrowbar
There are two ways to install OpenCrowbar.  The best way for you depends on what you are planning to do.

* If you are planning on installing and using OpenCrowbar but not necessarly doing development then use the RPM installation.
 [deploy OpenCrowbar onto a CentOS 6.6 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 _admin_ node](./Install-CentOS-RHEL-6.6-AdminNode.md).


**Please Note: When getting the packages you will have a choice to get the current Development version (Develop Branch) or the current 
released version (Master Branch).  If you do not choose then you will get the current released version.**

* If you are familiar with containers or are planning on doing a lot of development where you will be cycling and testing 
the code base then see the [Development Guide] (/doc/development-guides/README.md).
