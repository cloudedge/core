## Connecting to the BMC Network

By default, Crowbar sets up a BMC network on 192.168.128.xxx/24 named `the_bmc` in the category `bmc` and the group `internal`.  You may, of course, modify 
this by changing values from the `/networks` page.  These instructions have been created with the assumption that you are using the default 
network and should be modified to match your specific configuration.
